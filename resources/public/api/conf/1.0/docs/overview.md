This is an API that allows basic testing of API Platform functionality in order to verify that requests
for different endpoint URI patterns are accepted and make it down to the back end microservice.

This enables us to verify that the endpoint URI patterns provided to WSO2 by the `api-definition` service
for endpoints involving path and/or query parameters successfully allow the requests through.
